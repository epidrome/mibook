title: Xerox Star Genealogy Tree
caption: The Xerox Star genealogy tree includes many important ancestors (e.g., Memex, NLS, Sketchpad, etc), as well as equally important descendants (e.g.,  Macintosh), while the core human interaction elements (e.g., graphical user interface, direct manipulation) remain the same over several decades.
